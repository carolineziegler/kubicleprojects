# **Kubicle Data Science Projects**

This repository contains two Python projects developed as part of Kubicle data science training. Each project focuses on different aspects of data handling and analysis in Python.
Projects Overview

    Predicting Frost Risks for Vineyards - This project uses historical weather data to predict the risk of frost in vineyards, which is crucial for preventing crop damage.

    Clean Nutritional Data - This project involves cleaning and preparing nutritional data for analysis, ensuring the data is accurate and suitable for making health-related decisions.

## **Getting Started**
Prerequisites

Before you run these projects, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine, along with several libraries each project depends on, such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

You can install Python from python.org and the necessary libraries using pip:

bash

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

## **Installation**

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started with these projects:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kubicle-projects.git
cd kubicle-projects

## **Project Details**
### **Project 1: Predicting Frost Risks for Vineyards**

    Objective: Use temperature data to predict potential frost events that could damage vine crops.
    Data: The project utilizes temperature readings from various locations within a vineyard over multiple years.
    Usage:

    bash

    python "Project 1 - Predicting Frost Risks for Vineyards.py"

### **Project 2: Clean Nutritional Data**

    Objective: Clean and preprocess raw nutritional data obtained from various food items.
    Data: The dataset includes nutritional values like calories, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals.
    Usage:

    bash

python "Project 2 - Clean Nutritional Data.py"
